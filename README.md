# CSV-to-Tab-Delimited

## Overview
Write an object oriented program to transform a CSV file into a several tab delimited files.  For example, the CSV will be in the format of STUDENT_ID, STUDENT_NAME, SCHOOL.  

The CSV should contain the following data:

7,Mike Jones,Harvard

9,Dave Adams,Columbia

1,Amy Washington,Harvard

44,William Harrison,Yale

11,Erica August,Harvard

33,John Kochem,Columbia

99,Derek Carney,Columbia

The java program will read this CSV file in and produce a separate tab delimited file for each school.  Your program must be flexible enough to handle any number of schools.  Also, you should create a Student class that contains id, name and school variables.  As you loop through the students, you should instantiate a new Student for each row.
